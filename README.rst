Code Tanks
==========

Tanks controlled by *your* code, networked.

Uses zeromq for comunication between modules. Pygame for viewer and server, and
anything you like (as long as it has support for thrift and zeromq) for controlling the tanks.

A tank can shoot at other tanks and move around. Last tank standing wins.
